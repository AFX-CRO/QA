		<p>Dear Reader,</p>

		<p>With dozens of digital currencies exploding as high as 3,475%, 21,611% and even 81,465%...</p>

		<p>Historians will call today&rsquo;s cryptocurrency market the biggest BOOM ever!</p>

		<p>And if you&rsquo;re missing out&hellip;</p>

		<p>You could be cheating yourself out of the only chance you&rsquo;ll EVER have&hellip;</p>

		<p>To turn a single $100 bill into a retirement fortune&hellip; in a matter of months.</p>

		<p>And it couldn&rsquo;t be easier.</p>

		<p>Even if you know nothing about cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

		<p>All you have to do is follow my simple, 3-step script you see below.</p>
		<img alt="3 Step Script" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-01.png" />
		<p>Because <u>every single BOOM</u> throughout history has followed this script.</p>

		<p>The stock market boom in the roaring &rsquo;20s&hellip;</p>

		<p>The tech boom in the 1990s&hellip;</p>

		<p>The housing boom in the 2000s&hellip;</p>

		<p>And now the booming cryptocurrency market is following this exact same 3-step script.</p>

		<p>Using this roadmap, I already made an investment that returned a total profit of $1.8 million&hellip;</p>

		<p>From one single cryptocurrency trade!</p>

		<p>And before you guess, it was <em>not</em> Bitcoin&hellip; the &ldquo;granddaddy&rdquo; of all cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>You see, Bitcoin gained a lot of publicity after it turned many regular folks into millionaires.</p>

		<p>As <em>The Economist</em> magazine says...</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Anyone clever or lucky enough to have bought $1,000 of Bitcoins in July 2010, when the price stood at $0.05, would now have a stash worth $46 million.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The thing is&hellip;</p>

		<p><strong>The fast money in Bitcoin <u>has already been made.</u></strong></p>

		<p>It was easy to make a quick fortune when Bitcoin was trading for pennies.</p>

		<p>But now that the digital currency is trading around $4,000&hellip;</p>

		<p>It will be harder for you to make millions from Bitcoin going forward.</p>

		<p>But if you missed the Bitcoin boom, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because this year hundreds of smaller cryptocurrencies have popped up.</p>

		<p>And unlike the &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; Bitcoin&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Many of These Lesser-Known Digital<br class="hidebr" />
		Currencies Are Trading for Pennies!</h3>

		<p>In fact, I recently bought another cryptocurrency for just 52 cents!</p>

		<p>And it&rsquo;s already up 800%... in just three weeks!</p>

		<p>Many other cryptos are trading for pocket change.</p>

		<p>That means you could get started with a single $100 bill&hellip;</p>

		<p>And if you follow my proven 3-step script&hellip;</p>

		<p>You could cash out with a retirement fortune just a few months from now&hellip;</p>

		<p>Just like what happened with early Bitcoin investors.</p>

		<p>I know that&rsquo;s a huge claim&hellip;</p>

		<p>But this kind of get-rich-quick opportunity is ALREADY happening.</p>

		<p>Look what happened with Verge, a new cryptocurrency that improved upon Bitcoin&rsquo;s privacy technology.</p>

		<p>Most people have never heard of it&hellip;</p>

		<p>But had you invested a single $100 bill earlier this year&hellip;</p>

		<p>You could have cashed out with $57,236&hellip;</p>

		<p>In a little more than two months.</p>
		<img alt="$57,236" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-02.png" />
		<p>Isn&rsquo;t that incredible?</p>

		<p>In my entire 30+ year career on Wall Street&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen any other investment that could make as much as 572 times your money&hellip; in just a couple of months.</p>

		<p>And Verge is not the only cryptocurrency that&rsquo;s booming.</p>

		<p>Look what happened with DigiByte, a digital currency designed to protect its users against cyber threats.</p>

		<p>Just a few months ago, you could have bought it for pennies!</p>

		<p>And had you put in $100 earlier this year&hellip;</p>

		<p>It would have ballooned to as much as $30,628.</p>
		<img alt="Digibyte Charts" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-03.png" />
		<p>Again, this explosion happened in a matter of months.</p>

		<p>And you can make even more money if you&rsquo;re a little more ambitious.</p>

		<p>The more you put in&hellip; the higher your gains.</p>

		<p>In the case of DigiByte, for example&hellip;</p>

		<p>You could have turned a $2,000 investment into a $612,578 retirement fortune.</p>

		<p>Most people can&rsquo;t make that kind of money in their lifetime.</p>

		<p>And yet, you could have done it in just a couple of months earlier this year.</p>

		<p>Amazing, right?</p>

		<p>Something similar happened with another cryptocurrency called Nexus&hellip;</p>

		<p>Had you invested $100 when it was trading for pennies&hellip;</p>

		<p>You could have walked away with $66,666!</p>
		<img alt="$66,666" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-04.png" />
		<p>Invest a little more, say, $2,000&hellip;</p>

		<p>And you&rsquo;d be looking at an incredible payout of more than $1.3 million.</p>

		<p>Imagine&hellip;</p>

		<p>You, a certified millionaire in a matter of months&hellip; from one single trade.</p>

		<p>Do you see now why historians will call this the biggest financial boom ever?</p>

		<p>And here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;</p>

		<p>As incredible as these gains are&hellip;</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s just a small taste of what&rsquo;s coming in the next 12 months.</p>

		<p>How do I know that?</p>

		<p>Because so far cryptocurrencies are following a script that has been proven over, over and over again&hellip;</p>

		<p>Throughout every single financial boom in history.</p>

		<p>And according to this script&hellip;</p>

		<h3>We&rsquo;re on the Verge of a Massive Buying Frenzy&hellip; Starting With a Single Event on February 2</h3>

		<p>Even though one of my investments already returned $1.8 million from a single cryptocurrency trade&hellip;</p>

		<p>I expect to make much more in the coming months&hellip;</p>

		<p>Especially after February 2.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s when a single event is set to send cryptocurrencies into an epic parabolic move.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll give you more details in just a moment.</p>

		<p>But what you need to know right now is that I&rsquo;m not just making some sort of far-fetched guess.</p>

		<p>This is all part of my 3-step script I&rsquo;ve been telling you about.</p>

		<p>And while most people don&rsquo;t know how to use this simple roadmap&hellip;</p>

		<p>Every single boom in history has followed this script&hellip;</p>

		<p>With no exception!</p>
		<img alt="3 Step Script" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-01.png" />
		<p>Simply put, if you follow this script&hellip;</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll have a chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune in the coming months&hellip;</p>

		<p>All while cutting your risk to virtually zero.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the good news.</p>

		<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the bad news&hellip;</p>

		<p>Like every single boom in history, this cryptocurrency bonanza won&rsquo;t last forever.</p>

		<p>In fact, it could be all over by next year.</p>

		<p>And when it&rsquo;s over, you&rsquo;ll NEVER see a get-rich-quick opportunity like this again&hellip;</p>

		<p>Not in your lifetime.</p>

		<p>What does that mean for you?</p>

		<p>It means today you have a very small window of opportunity to act&hellip;</p>

		<p>One that&rsquo;s closing with each passing day. In fact&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Every Day You Wait, Someone Else is Growing Rich from Cryptocurrencies</h3>

		<p>Just take a look at the recent gains from some of these digital currencies&hellip;</p>
		<img alt="Digital Currency Gains" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Image-01.png" />
		<p>These are NOT annual gains.</p>

		<p>These are NOT monthly gains.</p>

		<p>These are gains that happened in a 24-hour period!</p>

		<p>Some of these cryptocurrencies are jumping 28%... 49%... and even 90%...</p>

		<p>In a SINGLE DAY!</p>

		<p>Look at your retirement statement right now&hellip;</p>

		<p>I have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing with your money&hellip;</p>

		<p>But I guarantee you&rsquo;re NOT making these types of daily gains.</p>

		<p>These gains are unheard of!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s why historians will call this the biggest BOOM ever!</p>

		<p>And if you miss it&hellip;</p>

		<p>I guarantee you&rsquo;ll regret it for the rest of your life.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing this urgent message&hellip;</p>

		<p>To show you how to use my proven 3-step script&hellip;</p>

		<p>The same script that helped my team of venture capitalists pocket $1.8 million in a matter of months.</p>

		<h3>But Before I Give You All the Details I Should Probably Introduce Myself</h3>

		<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m James Altucher.</p>

		<p>If my name sounds familiar, maybe you&rsquo;ve read one of my 18 books, including best-sellers <em>The Power of No</em> and <em>Choose Yourself</em>&hellip;</p>

		<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve read some of my articles published in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The Financial Times</em> and <em>The New York Observer</em>&hellip;</p>

		<p>Or listened to my podcast &ldquo;The James Altucher Show,&rdquo; which has more than 20 million downloads.</p>

		<p>If you look me up online, you&rsquo;ll see that the popular website Wikipedia describes me as&hellip;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;A hedge fund manager, entrepreneur, best-selling author, venture capitalist and podcaster who has founded or cofounded more than 20 companies.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>I guess they forgot to mention I&rsquo;m also a computer nerd.</p>

		<p>I wrote my first computer program in 1982 on an Apple II+&hellip;</p>

		<p>And I&rsquo;ve been a coder and hacker for the past 35 years!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m telling you this because when it comes to cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a BIG deal.</p>

		<p>You see, these digital currencies are created by computer programmers.</p>

		<p>That means you can only fully understand them if you can read the code behind each currency.</p>

		<p>And that&rsquo;s my bread and butter.</p>

		<p>I even know many of the computer geeks who are actually developing these currencies.</p>

		<p>And thanks to my nerdy background, I&rsquo;ve been neck deep in cryptocurrencies since 2013.</p>

		<p>In fact, that same year I created what was probably the first Bitcoin online &ldquo;store&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Where I presold my book <em>Choose Yourself</em> exclusively on Bitcoin.</p>

		<p>At the time, CNBC even invited me to talk about it on live TV.</p>

		<p>The anchor was totally skeptical of Bitcoin.</p>

		<p>He insinuated I didn&rsquo;t really care about cryptocurrencies&hellip; and was just pulling a marketing stunt.</p>

		<h3>You can see my shocking response in the 30-second clip below&hellip;</h3>

		<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="max-height:360px;max-width:640px; margin:0 auto; margin-bottom: 2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);">
		<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_3b7lfykguy videoFoam=true playbar=false fullscreenButton=false  playButton=true autoPlay=false" style="max-width:640px;max-height:360px;">&nbsp;</div>
		</div>

		<p>While I was telling everyone Bitcoin would succeed&hellip;</p>

		<p>The mainstream media was saying the exact opposite.</p>

		<p>A contributor for <em>Business Insider</em> called Bitcoin &ldquo;something strange.&rdquo; And they questioned &ldquo;why anyone would think it&rsquo;s useful.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>A CNN op-ed said it was &ldquo;a big scam designed to enrich its shadowy creators&rdquo;&hellip; and &ldquo;a bubble that could soon pop.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>And <em>Slate</em> published an article with the headline &ldquo;Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme &mdash; the internet&rsquo;s favorite currency will collapse.&rdquo;</p>

		<p><strong>So if you missed the Bitcoin boom, it&rsquo;s not your fault.</strong></p>

		<p>The mainstream media simply &ldquo;brainwashed&rdquo; most Americans into thinking Bitcoin was a scam.</p>

		<p>Well, had you ignored the clueless mainstream media&hellip;</p>

		<p>And listened to what I said on CNBC instead&hellip;</p>

		<p>You would be up 3,710% today.</p>
		<img alt="3,710%" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-05.png" />
		<p>That&rsquo;s more than 38 times your money in the last four years&hellip;</p>

		<p>Enough to turn a small retirement account of 10 grand into a $381,044 retirement fortune!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m telling you this because I want you to realize that the mainstream media is clueless when it comes to new technologies.</p>

		<p>Case in point&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Let Me Show You One More Example Where I Was Actually Mocked on Live TV</h3>

		<p>In 2007, shortly after Yahoo offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion&hellip;</p>

		<p>I went on CNBC and predicted the company would be worth at least $100 billion.</p>

		<p>They thought I was crazy. And I was actually mocked on live TV.</p>

		<p>You can see the short 30-second clip below. (It&#39;s quite entertaining.)</p>

		<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="max-height:360px;max-width:640px; margin:0 auto; margin-bottom: 2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);">
		<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_zfeu85ylia videoFoam=true playbar=false fullscreenButton=false  playButton=true autoPlay=false" style="max-width:640px;max-height:360px;">&nbsp;</div>
		</div>

		<p>Today, Facebook is worth more than $400 billion&hellip;</p>

		<p>And had you bought shares 5 years ago, you&rsquo;d be up 870%!</p>
		<img alt="Facebook" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-06.png" />
		<p>A few years after I made my Facebook prediction, CNBC published this headline&hellip; admitting I was right!</p>
		<img alt="Altucher Called Facebook $100 Billion Company in '07" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_23_17_Quote_01.png" width="80%" />
		<p>Bottom line&hellip;</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t expect the mainstream media to show you how to make a fortune from new tech trends, including digital currencies.</p>

		<p>Because they&rsquo;re always late to the party.</p>

		<p>Without my 3-step script, they&rsquo;re totally lost.</p>

		<p>Not to mention that there&rsquo;s a lot of misinformation out of there&hellip;</p>

		<p>Some of my followers are getting scammed into investing in the wrong cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve made it my mission to reveal the TRUTH about making money in this booming market.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to set the record straight.</p>

		<p>So please pay close attention&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because in the next few minutes, I will show you how to use the same script my team of venture capitalists used to bank $1.8 million in a matter of months.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll show you what I&rsquo;m doing with my own money&hellip; my family&rsquo;s fortune&hellip; the money I plan to leave to my kids and grandkids.</p>

		<p>Then you can decide for yourself if this is right for you.</p>

		<p>But the truth is&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Dozens of Cryptocurrencies Are Exploding 3,475%, 21,611% and Even 81,465%... in a Matter of Months</h3>

		<p>Take a look&hellip;</p>
		<img alt="Cryptocurrency Explosions" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Image-02.png" />
		<p>The few people who understand what&rsquo;s going on are already making a life-changing fortune.</p>

		<p>People like Alan A., a 47-year-old San Franciscan.</p>

		<p>Less than a year ago, he bought three digital currencies&hellip;. Ether, Golem and Gnosis.</p>

		<p>Within six months, he turned his $8,500 initial investment into $7.5 million!</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a return of 88,000%... in a matter of months!</p>

		<p>Incredible, right?</p>

		<p>Sean I. from New York scored big wins in cryptocurrencies like Game, Litecoin, Ripple and Dogecoin.</p>

		<p>And he was able to turn his initial stake of $15,000 into a $3 million fortune&hellip;</p>

		<p>In less than two years.</p>

		<p>After becoming a crypto millionaire, he said:</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Anybody right now with half a mind and at least four fingers can click some buttons and get in on this inevitable exponential rise in crypto and make <u>an INSANE amount of money</u>.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>As amazing as these gains are&hellip;</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s just the beginning&hellip;</p>

		<p>A small taste of what&rsquo;s coming.</p>

		<p>Because on February 2, there&rsquo;s a single event taking place at precisely 4 p.m.</p>

		<p>And it could trigger a mad rush into cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>If you take a position right now&hellip;</p>

		<p>In the right cryptos (I&rsquo;ll show you which ones)&hellip;</p>

		<p>You could turn a single $100 bill into a retirement fortune in the next 12 months.</p>

		<p>And don&rsquo;t worry if you&rsquo;ve never invested in cryptocurrencies before&hellip;</p>

		<p>Even if you have no clue what a digital currency is&hellip;</p>

		<p>You could still walk away with a life-changing fortune&hellip;</p>

		<p>First, let me show you how this cryptocurrency script works&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Getting Rich from Cryptocurrencies Could be as Easy as 1-2-3</h3>

		<p>The boom in cryptocurrencies is following the same script that has played out over, over and over again.</p>

		<p>You see, every boom follows a sequence of three stages&hellip;</p>

		<p>First, only early enthusiasts are courageous enough to invest in the new trend.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s stage 1.</p>

		<p>Then, institutional investors (the so-called &ldquo;smart money&rdquo;) jump in.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s stage 2.</p>

		<p>Finally, the public joins the party, triggering a massive explosion in price.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s stage 3.</p>

		<p>If you know how to use this roadmap, you could make an absolute fortune.</p>

		<p>And to help you understand how this 1-2-3 sequence works&hellip;</p>

		<p>Let me show you what happened during the 1990s boom in tech stocks.</p>

		<p>In the mid-1990s, most people didn&rsquo;t even know what the internet was.</p>

		<p>In 1994, the morning show NBC&#39;s Today had a segment where one of the anchors asked, &ldquo;What is the internet, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>While most people were dismissing the technology as a fad...</p>

		<p>Early adopters like myself were heavily investing in it.</p>

		<p>In 1995, I correctly predicted every company would need a website. So I started my first internet company to help big corporations get online.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s how I ended up building the first websites for American Express, HBO, Sony and Disney, among others.</p>

		<p>That was stage 1 of the boom!</p>
		<img alt="Stage 1" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-07.png" />
		<p>Only when Netscape went public in late 1995 did people outside Silicon Valley start taking the internet seriously.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s when institutional investors started joining the party&hellip;</p>

		<p>With pension funds and venture capitalists making a fortune when companies like Yahoo and Amazon went public.</p>

		<p>The additional flow of money from the &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; helped pushed tech stocks even higher.</p>

		<p>That was stage 2 of the boom.</p>
		<img alt="Stage 2" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-08.png/" />
		<p>But the public was still not participating.</p>

		<p>In June 1998, for example, mainstream economist Paul Krugman predicted the internet&rsquo;s impact on the economy would be no greater than the fax machine.</p>

		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 1999 that the masses finally started to invest heavily in tech stocks&hellip;</p>

		<p>With more people jumping into the market&hellip;</p>

		<p>Tech stocks jumped even higher&hellip;</p>

		<p>Attracting more and more people wanting to get a piece of the action.</p>

		<p>And that was the third and most explosive stage of the boom&hellip;</p>

		<p>With the Nasdaq soaring more than 85% in 1999 alone.</p>
		<img alt="The 1-2-3 Script During the Tech Boom" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-09.png" />
		<p>I&rsquo;m telling you this because my research shows that cryptocurrencies are following this exact same script&hellip;</p>

		<p>First, early enthusiasts&hellip;</p>

		<p>Then, institutional investors&hellip;</p>

		<p>And finally the public.</p>

		<p>So keep this sequence in mind&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because in just a moment, I&rsquo;ll show you how you can use this simple script to turn $100 into a retirement fortune&hellip; in the next 12 months.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no need to risk your hard-earned money trying to guess when these currencies will move&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Because Every Single Boom in History Has Followed this Script</h3>

		<p>The so-called roaring &rsquo;20s followed this same roadmap&hellip;</p>

		<p>First, only early enthusiasts invested in the new technologies of the time, such as radio, the car and easy access to electric power.</p>

		<p>Then in 1924 institutional investors jumped in&hellip;</p>

		<p>Finally, in the late 1920s the news started reporting stories of overnight fortunes.</p>

		<p>And regular folks started to wonder: Why not me?</p>

		<p>They started borrowing money just to buy stocks. The result?</p>

		<p>Stocks went straight up. In 1928 alone, the stock market doubled.</p>
		<img alt="The 1-2-3 Script During the Roaring 20s" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-10.png" />
		<p>And it&rsquo;s not just stock booms that follow this 3-step script, either. The US housing boom also followed this roadmap&hellip;</p>

		<p>Take a look&hellip;</p>

		<p>The biggest jump in housing prices happened from 2003 to 2006&hellip;</p>

		<p>When we entered stage 3 of the boom&hellip; and flipping houses became a national obsession.</p>
		<img alt="The 1-2-3 Script During the Housing Boom" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-11.png" />
		<p>And it&rsquo;s not just here in the US.</p>

		<p>Something similar happened during the historic boom in Japanese stocks&hellip;</p>

		<p>With the masses pushing stocks straight up during stage 3&hellip; in the 1980s.</p>
		<img alt="The 1-2-3 Script During the Japanese Boom" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-12.png" />
		<p>This script is so reliable that it goes back centuries&hellip;</p>

		<p>Just look what happened with shares of the South Sea Company in 1720&hellip;</p>
		<img alt="The 1-2-3 Script in the South Sea Company" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-13.png" />
		<p>And with the boom in tulip bulbs in Holland during the early 1600s.</p>
		<img alt="The 1-2-3 Script in the Tulip Boom" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-14.png" />
		<p>Isn&rsquo;t that incredible?</p>

		<p>No matter what asset class&hellip;</p>

		<p>No matter the geographic location&hellip;</p>

		<p>And no matter what year the boom happened...</p>

		<p>Every single boom throughout history has followed the same script.</p>

		<p><u>It works 100% of the time.</u></p>

		<p>And in each one of those booms, people who knew how to use this script walked away with a fortune.</p>

		<p>Those who didn&rsquo;t... lost all their money</p>

		<h3>I&rsquo;m Telling You All This Because This Script Is Playing Out Again RIGHT NOW in the Booming Cryptocurrency Market!</h3>

		<p>So where are we now in this digital currency boom?</p>

		<p>Let me you walk you through the three stages, using Bitcoin as an example&hellip;</p>

		<p>When Bitcoin &ldquo;went public&rdquo; in 2010, very few people understood the opportunity.</p>

		<p>Much like the internet in 1994, most people dismissed it as a useless technology.</p>

		<p>Only early enthusiasts invested in Bitcoin&hellip;</p>

		<p>People like Brian Z., from San Francisco.</p>

		<p>Back in 2010 he bought about 20,000 Bitcoins&hellip;</p>

		<p>When the digital currency was trading for just over 15 cents.</p>

		<p>Well, that initial investment of $3,000 is now worth as astounding $85.9 million!</p>

		<p>He now spends his days traveling the world in ultra-luxurious style&hellip; staying exclusively in 5-star suites. He says:</p>

		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>&ldquo;I have everything I&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of. I fly all over the world visiting friends, I do whatever I want with my time and <strong><u>I never have to worry about money for the rest of my life.</u></strong>&rdquo;</p>
		</div>

		<p>Imagine if that happened to you!</p>

		<p>That could be your reality a few months from now&hellip;</p>

		<p>But only if you invest in the right smaller cryptocurrencies&hellip; the ones that are still cheap.</p>

		<p>Because the truth is&hellip; <strong>the big money in Bitcoin has already been made by early enthusiasts.</strong></p>

		<p>That was stage 1 of the boom.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve moved into stage 2 around 2014...</p>

		<p>When institutional investors, aka &ldquo;the smart money,&rdquo; started investing in Bitcoin.</p>

		<p>Let me show you how&hellip;</p>

		<h3>The Smart Money is Going All In</h3>

		<p>What started in 2014 has only intensified this year.</p>

		<p>You see, the &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; is not just looking at Bitcoin anymore.</p>

		<p>With hundreds of cryptocurrencies exploding 3,475%, 21,611% and even 81,465%...</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re now investing in these smaller, lesser-known digital currencies.</p>

		<p><em>Forbes</em> even published the following headline recently&hellip;</p>
		<img alt="CryptoBoom" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_23_17_Quote_06.png" width="80%" />
		<p>And went on to say:</p>

		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>&ldquo;Given how many new crypto millionaires have been minted&hellip; old hands in finance who&nbsp;want in on this new world of value are launching funds.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>

		<p>Aside from these 15 new hedge funds&hellip;</p>

		<p>There are 70 more in the pipeline!</p>

		<p>Once all these 70 funds get set up, billions in new capital will flow into these cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

		<p>Helping push them even higher.</p>

		<p>Ronni Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, explains this gold rush:</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The floodgates are opening. I believe there are hedge funds and very deep-pocketed individuals going into this now, really hundreds of millions of dollars.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>And get this&hellip;</p>

		<p>Fidelity, which has $6.2 trillion in assets under management, has just partnered with Coinbase, the most popular cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

		<p>Imagine what will happen if some of those trillions start moving into cryptos!</p>

		<p>Simply put, institutional investors are jumping in with both feet. This is all part of stage 2 of my script.</p>

		<h3>And to Prove My Point,<br class="hidebr" />
		Here&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Inside Scoop&rdquo;&hellip;</h3>

		<p>Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital are two of the most highly respected venture capital firms in Silicon Valley.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s because they tend to see major technology trends before anyone else.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve made billions by investing very early in social media companies like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.</p>

		<p>Simply put, when these guys invest in something new, you should pay close attention.</p>

		<p>Well, <em>Forbes</em> has just reported that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;secretly&rdquo; investing in a cryptocurrency fund called MetaStable.</p>

		<p>And I knew that way before the media reported on it. How?</p>

		<p>Because I&rsquo;m good friends with one of the founders of the fund.</p>

		<p>To billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; TV show star.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m also connected with just about every big hedge fund manager in Manhattan&hellip;</p>

		<p>And every major venture capital firm on both the East Coast and in Silicon Valley.</p>

		<p>I can see behind the scenes that the &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; is now getting heavily involved in cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>My billionaire friend Mark Cuban is investing in it... Google is in it&hellip; and so is billionaire Richard Branson.</p>

		<h3>With All This Money Flowing In, It&rsquo;s No Wonder Many Cryptocurrencies are Exploding this Year</h3>

		<p>Remember when I said you could turn $100 into a retirement fortune?</p>

		<p>Look what happened with a little-known cryptocurrency called NEM.</p>

		<p>It has jumped as high as 291,142% in the last couple of years.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s enough to turn a single $100 bill into $291,242.</p>
		<img alt="NEM Charts" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-15.png" />
		<p>That&rsquo;s more than three times what the average retiree has in their retirement account.</p>

		<p>Amazing, right?</p>

		<p>Imagine adding almost $300,000 to your nest egg&hellip;</p>

		<p>Starting with just $100&hellip; in just a couple of years!</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the power of these smaller cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>Or look what happened with another digital currency called Ethereum&hellip;</p>
		<img alt="Ethereum" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-16.png" />
		<p>Had you put in just $500&hellip;</p>

		<p>It would have ballooned into a retirement fortune of as much as $407,822&hellip; in just a couple of years.</p>

		<p>And if you invested a little more, you could&rsquo;ve literally walked away with millions.</p>

		<p>For example, a $5,000 investment in another cryptocurrency called SibCoin&hellip;</p>

		<p>Could have paid you a $2.8 million fortune&hellip; in a matter of months.</p>
		<img alt="SIBCoin Charts" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-17.png" />
		<p>Isn&rsquo;t that incredible?</p>

		<p>No wonder the &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; wants a piece of the pie.</p>

		<p>Look, I recently had lunch with several hedge fund managers and other &ldquo;Wall Streeters&rdquo; in New York&hellip;</p>

		<p>And they were all asking me about cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>They want to know how to get involved&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because they know we&rsquo;ll NEVER see a boom like this again.</p>

		<h3>But While the &ldquo;Smart Money&rdquo; is Going All In&hellip; Everyday Folks Are Totally in the Dark</h3>

		<p>If you don&rsquo;t know anything about cryptocurrencies, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>

		<p>You are NOT alone.</p>

		<p>Despite the massive investments from &ldquo;the smart money&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Despite all the newly minted millionaires&hellip;</p>

		<p>And despite this exploding market&hellip;</p>

		<p>Most people don&rsquo;t even know what a cryptocurrency is.</p>

		<p>To this date, less than one in ten thousand people has invested in Bitcoin.</p>

		<p>Just ask your friends, spouse and neighbors what they think of Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero.</p>

		<p>I bet they&rsquo;ll have no clue what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s because the masses are NOT participating in this boom.</p>

		<p>Not yet!</p>

		<p>Professor Panos M., Chair of the Department of Economics at Long Island University in New York, agrees with me.</p>

		<p>He said we&rsquo;re still missing &ldquo;a broad participation beyond the &lsquo;pioneers&rsquo; and the &lsquo;early adopters.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

		<p>And that&rsquo;s the key to my 3-step script.</p>

		<p>Remember, the biggest gains in any bull market throughout history only happen when the public joins the trend.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the masses that will push cryptocurrencies to the moon.</p>

		<h3>And That&rsquo;s Exactly What&rsquo;s Set to Happen on February 2</h3>

		<p>You see, with cryptocurrencies minting new millionaires seemly everyday&hellip;</p>

		<p>This epic boom is starting to grab some headlines.</p>

		<p>Take a look&hellip;</p>
		<img alt="The Guardian" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_23_17_Quote_02.png" width="80%" /><br />

		<img alt="Henry Blodget" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_23_17_Quote_05.png" width="80%" />
		<p>With cryptocurrencies gaining publicity&hellip;</p>

		<p>The masses will NOT remain on the sideline for much longer.</p>

		<p>In fact, I want you to mark February 2 on your calendar&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Because this Single Event is About to Catapult Cryptocurrencies into the Third and Most Explosive Stage of the Boom</h3>

		<p>Simply put, this event will trigger a buying frenzy&hellip;</p>

		<p>And help mint a new round of crypto millionaires.</p>

		<p>You see, big tech companies like Microsoft and Overstockare already accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.</p>

		<p>But what would happen if the world&rsquo;s largest online retailer started doing the same?</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re about to find out&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because with the popularity of Bitcoin exploding&hellip;</p>

		<p>With people like Bill Gates saying cryptocurrencies are &ldquo;the future of money&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

		<p>And with big economies like Japan legalizing Bitcoin as a form of payment&hellip;</p>

		<p><strong>I am certain that Amazon WILL ACCEPT Bitcoin. </strong></p>

		<p><strong>They have no choice. And this will be the tipping point that will create massive generational wealth unlike we&rsquo;ve ever seen before. </strong></p>

		<p>Of course only Amazon&rsquo;s CEO Jeff Bezos knows for sure the exact date this will happen&hellip;</p>

		<p>But given the company&#39;s history of staying ahead of its retail rivals&hellip;</p>

		<p>Amazon could make the announcement as early as February 2, at 4 p.m., during its next earnings conference call.</p>

		<p>Which is why you need to act RIGHT NOW.</p>

		<p>You see, eBay, Amazon&rsquo;s biggest competitor, has already expressed interest in accepting Bitcoin payment.</p>

		<p>And according to Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, Amazon will soon have no choice but to start accepting Bitcoins. He said:</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They have to follow suit. I&rsquo;ll be stunned if they don&rsquo;t, because they can&rsquo;t just cede that part of the market to us, if we&rsquo;re the only main, large retail site taking Bitcoin.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Look, Amazon Web Services has already been working with Digital Currency Group, one of the biggest investors in the cryptocurrency technology.</p>

		<p>And Amazon executive Scott Mullins has confirmed it&hellip;</p>

		<p>Amazon is &ldquo;working with financial institutions and [crypto experts] to spur innovation and facilitate frictionless experimentation.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>According to my research, they could make the announcement by February 2nd.</p>

		<p>Once that happens, the impact on cryptocurrencies will be huge.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll see a buying frenzy like never before.</p>

		<p>It&#39;ll be like a Black Friday crowd at Best Buy.</p>

		<p>Only those who get in early will get a good deal.</p>

		<p>Most people will be left out.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why I urge you to get in right now&hellip;</p>

		<p>Get ahead of the crowd&hellip;</p>

		<p>Ahead of the massive buying frenzy that will push cryptocurrencies straight up.</p>

		<p>Like I showed you today, every boom follows this 3-step script&hellip;</p>

		<p>First, only early adopters bought Bitcoin.</p>

		<p>Then, the smart money started joining the party.</p>

		<p>And now we&rsquo;re about to enter the third and most explosive stage of the boom in cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>If you get in before February 2&hellip;</p>

		<p>You will have a rare chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune.</p>

		<p><u>After that date, this window of opportunity will be slammed shut forever.</u></p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll never see an opportunity like this again&hellip; not in your lifetime.</p>

		<h3>But DO NOT Rush to Buy Every Cryptocurrency Out There!</h3>

		<p>You see, right now there are 840 cryptocurrencies available.</p>

		<p>And if you blindly buy any of those&hellip;</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a 95% chance you&rsquo;ll lose all your money.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s because 95% of them are worthless&hellip; and will eventually go to zero.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the truth you won&rsquo;t hear anywhere else&hellip;</p>

		<p>Many of these digital currencies don&rsquo;t have the technology necessary to make them a viable form of money&hellip;</p>

		<p>Some can be printed willy-nilly&hellip;</p>

		<p>Others can be easily hacked&hellip;</p>

		<p>And others are simply a scam.</p>

		<p>How do I know that?</p>

		<p>Because aside from being a computer coder myself&hellip;</p>

		<p>I know other computer hackers who have looked into the codes of these currencies.</p>

		<p>For example, one of my contacts analyzed the cryptocurrency The DAO&hellip; and discovered it was very susceptible to hacking.</p>

		<p>I stayed away from that specific digital currency.</p>

		<p>Sure enough, it was hacked&hellip; and investors lost millions.</p>

		<p>Look, I&rsquo;ll be the first to concede that most of these tiny cryptocurrencies are risky speculations&hellip;</p>

		<p>But if you&rsquo;re avoiding ALL cryptocurrencies, well&hellip;</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re costing yourself tens of thousands... even millions of dollars!</p>

		<p>Because the truth is&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Cryptocurrencies Are Here to Stay!</h3>

		<p>They&rsquo;re doing to money what the internet did to mail.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the future of money.</p>

		<p>Saying cryptocurrencies are going away, it&rsquo;s like saying the internet is going away.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>

		<p>But you&rsquo;ll only make money if you buy the RIGHT cryptocurrencies!</p>

		<p>Remember what happened during the 1990s tech boom?</p>

		<p>A lot of people made a fortune during the boom.</p>

		<p>I personally made $15 million in 1998 alone.</p>

		<p>And those who invested in enduring companies like Amazon, Google and eBay got very, very rich.</p>

		<p>At the same time, scores of foolish day traders and IPO junkies got crushed&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because they invested in the wrong tech companies&hellip;</p>

		<p>Companies that were worthless garbage.</p>

		<p>That history is repeating itself right now in the cryptocurrency space.</p>

		<p>Only a handful of these digital currencies can really help you make money&hellip;</p>

		<p>And I want to show you which ones.</p>

		<h3>Everything You Need to Know is<br class="hidebr" />
		Inside this FREE Package</h3>

		<div class="changes pop"><img alt="Package" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_2/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Book&amp;Video.jpg" width="80%" /></div>

		<p>To help you get started, I&rsquo;d like to send you this FREE package&hellip;</p>

		<p>Which includes my brand-new book and an exclusive 6-video series <em>Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies</em>.</p>

		<p>This package is NOT available on Amazon or anywhere else.</p>

		<p>But I&rsquo;ve reserved a free unit for you today.</p>

		<p>Inside the book <strong><em>Cryptocurrencies 101: How to Make a Fortune From Digital Currencies</em></strong>, you&rsquo;ll discover&hellip;</p>

		<p><strong>***The #1 cryptocurrency to buy right now.</strong> (No, it&rsquo;s not Bitcoin.)</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s already up 3,432% this year alone.</p>

		<p>But that&rsquo;s just the beginning. With Fortune 500 companies, like JP Morgan Chase, Intel and Microsoft, investing in this currency&hellip; the potential here is really explosive.</p>

		<p>Even better&hellip; it&rsquo;s trading for a fraction of Bitcoin&rsquo;s price.</p>

		<p>But it won&rsquo;t remain cheap for long. See the details on page 37.</p>

		<p><strong>***The #1 mistake cryptocurrency investors are making right now.</strong></p>

		<p>This could be the most important part of the book.</p>

		<p>Because a lot of people who are making this mistake will get wiped out. But you will NOT be one of them. (See page 43.)</p>

		<p><strong>***The computer geek secret to make sure your crypto account will NEVER be hacked.</strong></p>

		<p>Hint: You can do this even if you know nothing about computers. See page 25.</p>

		<p><strong>***The 3-step screening process my team of venture capitalists used to pocket $1.8 million in a matter of months.</strong></p>

		<p>With these 3 simple steps, you&rsquo;ll be able to tell which cryptocurrencies are legit&hellip; and which ones are a scam.</p>

		<p>If a currency does not check all these 3 boxes, forget about it. (Page 50.)</p>

		<p><strong>***How to invest in the booming cryptocurrency industry directly from your retirement account. </strong></p>

		<p>With this secret, you will not need to fill out extra paperwork&hellip; or open an account with a digital currency broker.</p>

		<p>You can even use your IRA. Simply follow my instructions on page 61.</p>

		<p>And much, much more&hellip;</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll find everything you need to get started inside this FREE book&hellip;</p>

		<p>From the philosophy behind digital currencies&hellip; to opening an account&hellip; to finding the right currencies to buy.</p>

		<p>And don&rsquo;t worry, investing in cryptocurrencies is so easy a kid can do it&hellip;</p>

		<p>Just look at Erik F., a 12-year-old kid from Idaho.</p>

		<p>He started with a small investment of $1,000 in Bitcoin&hellip;</p>

		<p>And was able to turn that into a $1.2 million fortune.</p>

		<p>If he can do it, anyone can!</p>

		<p>And to make your life even easier&hellip;</p>

		<h3>This Package Also Includes A Never-Before-Released 6-Video Series <em>Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies</em></h3>

		<p>You see, rather than just leaving you with a book&hellip;</p>

		<p>I wanted to walk you step by step through the entire process... on camera.</p>

		<p>So here&rsquo;s what I did&hellip;</p>

		<p>I used my contacts in New York to select four people who knew nothing about cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>I put them in a room with me&hellip; and got the cameras rolling.</p>

		<p>These are everyday folks just like you&hellip;</p>

		<p>People who want to make a fortune from cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

		<p>But don&rsquo;t know how to get started.</p>

		<p>I wanted to prove to you that anyone can do this.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve recorded everything and I&rsquo;d like to send you this 6-video masterclass for FREE.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll personally &ldquo;hold your hand&rdquo; and teach you everything I know about how to make money from cryptos.</p>

		<p>In a moment, I&rsquo;ll show you how you can access everything.</p>

		<p>First, you might be wondering why I&rsquo;d go through all this work&hellip;</p>

		<p>Why not just keep this information to myself and make a fortune?</p>

		<p>To answer that, let me tell you a very personal story that explains everything&hellip;</p>

		<h3>How My Bank Account Balance Went from $15 Million to Just $143</h3>

		<p>As I mentioned, I&rsquo;m already profiting from cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

		<p>And my team of venture capitalists even banked $1.8 million recently.</p>

		<p>But life has not always been this &ldquo;easy&rdquo; for me.</p>

		<p>You see, a few years ago I lost my entire life savings.</p>

		<p>Back in 1998, I made $15 million when I sold my first company, called Reset.</p>

		<p>But I was young and stupid.</p>

		<p>And within three and a half years, I went from millionaire to having just $143 left in my bank account.</p>

		<p>Let me tell you&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not a good feeling when you have no clue how you&rsquo;ll pay your mortgage&hellip; or your children&rsquo;s education.</p>

		<p>I was so broke and depressed that suicide crossed my mind.</p>

		<p>I thought maybe my two little girls would be better off with the $4 million payout from my life insurance policy.</p>

		<p>But then I recovered&hellip; got my act straight&hellip; and launched new, successful businesses.</p>

		<p>And here I am&hellip;</p>

		<p>Today I&rsquo;m doing everything I can to make sure my kids and grandkids will NEVER go through the financial nightmare I went through.</p>

		<p>And I don&rsquo;t want YOU to go through that either.</p>

		<p>Today you have a once-in-a-generation chance to secure a comfortable retirement&hellip; once and for all.</p>

		<p>I sincerely believe those who take the right steps today could make a killing from cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>A year from now, you could be traveling around the world&hellip;</p>

		<p>Spending time in your new luxury home in the south of France&hellip;</p>

		<p>Or simply drinking a cocktail with your loved ones in some exotic beach&hellip;</p>

		<p>With the peace of mind that only comes when you KNOW you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about money again.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m talking about making enough to fund your entire retirement&hellip;</p>

		<p>And still leave money for your kids and grandkids.</p>

		<h3>You Can Get Started Today with this FREE Cryptocurrency Package. Here&rsquo;s How to Claim It</h3>

		<p>Even though cryptocurrencies are the best investment opportunity I&rsquo;ve seen in my 35- year career&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not the only investment trend I follow.</p>

		<p>In fact, on the first weekday of every month&hellip;</p>

		<p>I publish a monthly income and opportunity briefing called <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>.</p>

		<p>I decided to launch this briefing because I know America is changing in profound ways.</p>

		<p>If you want a comfortable retirement&hellip;</p>

		<p>You can no longer rely on conventional institutions like the government, Wall Street firms or corporations.</p>

		<p>The truth is&hellip; if you don&rsquo;t choose the life you want to live&hellip;</p>

		<p>Chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you.</p>

		<p>And the results are probably not going to be pretty.</p>

		<p>And that&rsquo;s my mission in <em>The Altucher Report</em>&hellip;</p>

		<p>To help everyday American retirees end their reliance on conventional institutions&hellip;</p>

		<p>And learn how to grow your wealth and create your own streams of income&hellip;</p>

		<p>So you can live your retirement exactly how you want&hellip;</p>

		<p>Without EVER having to worry about money.</p>

		<p><em>The Altucher Report</em> is the only place where I&rsquo;ll personally update you on emerging new ways to earn more income and grow your wealth&hellip;</p>

		<p>It could be a new business idea&hellip;</p>

		<p>A potential deal with someone in my vast network of contacts&hellip;</p>

		<p>Or an explosive investment in a new, disruptive technology.</p>

		<p>Whenever I come across a unique opportunity, I&rsquo;ll tell you when to buy.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you when to sell.</p>

		<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you all of my analysis behind each recommended move.</p>

		<p>No guesswork.</p>

		<p>It couldn&rsquo;t get easier.</p>

		<p>And you can start today by claiming your FREE Cryptocurrency Package.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll send it to your doorstep as soon as you take a risk-free trial of <em>The Altucher Report</em>.</p>

		<p>My hope is that for you as a reader, it will be like having a wealthy friend who&rsquo;s a Silicon Valley insider&hellip;</p>

		<p>A friend who&rsquo;s an insider in the Manhattan financial world&hellip; and in the publishing and media world.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll share secrets, insights and ideas I promise you won&rsquo;t hear anywhere else.</p>

		<p>But don&#39;t take my word for it.</p>

		<h3>Here&rsquo;s What Others are Saying About My Work</h3>

		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>&ldquo;This man has changed my life, and the lives of thousands of people that follow his every word. He is the most valuable mentor I have.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>-Brian Rashid, Forbes Contributor</p>
		</div>

		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>&ldquo;I think that James is a national treasure and probably the most unique man anywhere right now in any kind of financial-related media.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Porter Stansberry, founder of Stansberry &amp; Associates Investment Research</p>
		</div>

		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>&ldquo;James Altucher is scary smart.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>-Stephen J. Dubner, 3 Times New York Times best-selling co-author of &lsquo;Freakonomics&rsquo;</p>
		</div>

		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>&ldquo;James is very honest about his life. Both his Successes as well as his Failures. He is a relentless idea machine and forward thinker.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&mdash;Don M.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>&ldquo;I was deeply influenced by your insights at a point in my life where I needed change. Since then I have quit my job, started a company and we are actually raising money. So just saying thanks, what you are doing matters.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&mdash;Dan Darel</p>
		</div>

		<div class="testimonial">
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reading James&rsquo; books, <em>The Altucher Report</em>, and listening to his podcasts for years. The reason why I&rsquo;ve spent so much time listening to James is that he provides a TON of value.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>-Bruce H.</p>
		</div>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad my work is already changing people&rsquo;s lives.</p>

		<p>And I want YOU to be the next success story&hellip;</p>

		<p>Starting with the once-in-a-generation opportunity in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

		<p>I know there&rsquo;s nothing like my Cryptocurrency Package available in the market.</p>

		<p>But I&rsquo;ve seen some live cryptocurrency training selling for more than $2,000.</p>

		<p>So I know I could easily sell this package for $199 on Amazon&hellip;</p>

		<p>And that would be an incredible bargain.</p>

		<p>But like I mentioned before, this is NOT for sale.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m making this available to my readers only.</p>

		<p>That means today this package can be yours FREE&hellip;</p>

		<p>As soon as you take a risk-free trial to <em>The Altucher Report</em>.</p>

		<p>And don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re not going to pay anywhere near $199 to take this risk-free trial.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you more about this special offer in just a moment.</p>

		<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to make this deal even sweeter by adding three special gifts for you&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Bonus Report #1: The 48X Back-Door Way to the Cryptocurrency Market</h3>
		<img alt="The 48X Back-Door Way to the Cryptocurrency Market" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/The48xBackDoorWaytoCryptocurrencyMarket.jpg" width="40%" />
		<p>During the famous California gold rush, those who mined gold made a fortune.</p>

		<p>But they were not the only ones.</p>

		<p>Those who provided the miners with picks, shovels and other equipment needed for gold mining also walked away with fortunes.</p>

		<p>The same thing will happen with the crypto rush.</p>

		<p>I found a handful of public companies that are involved in the sector.</p>

		<p>And you could easily beat the market with them&hellip; and make 5, 10 and even 20 times your money in the coming years.</p>

		<p>For example, take my cryptocurrency stock #1&hellip;</p>

		<p>This company produces the chips that are essential for the cryptocurrency industry to function.</p>

		<p>No wonder the stock has already jumped 771% in the last couple of years&hellip;</p>

		<p>In a time when the stock market went up just 16%!</p>
		<img alt="16%" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-18.png" />
		<p>That means you could have made 48 times MORE money than the overall market&hellip; just in the last couple of years.</p>

		<p>And that&rsquo;s just from one stock.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve identified two other opportunities&hellip; one in the retail space&hellip; and one in the cybersecurity space.</p>

		<p>And inside this report you&rsquo;ll get all the details on all three stocks&hellip;</p>

		<p>The ticker symbols&hellip; the analysis&hellip; when to buy&hellip; how much to pay, etc&hellip;</p>

		<p>This report is yours FREE when you take a risk-free trial of <em>The Altucher Report</em>.</p>

		<h3>Bonus Report #2: Make 1,000% from the Seven Biggest Money-Making Trends in America</h3>
		<img alt="Make 1,000% from the Seven Biggest Money-Making Trends in America" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/Make1000FromtheSeven-3D.png" width="50%" />
		<p>Most people never make 1,000% on a single investment in their lifetime.</p>

		<p>But if you understand what&rsquo;s about to happen next&hellip; it really is possible.</p>

		<p>And thanks to my extensive network that goes from Wall Street to Silicon Valley&hellip;</p>

		<p>I tend to hear about investment ideas BEFORE they become popular.</p>

		<p>And that&rsquo;s how you make BIG money&hellip; by getting in before the crowd.</p>

		<p>This is exactly how I&rsquo;ve made some great gains in recent years, including&hellip;</p>

		<p>6,000% on an early investment in Buddy Media (a social media platform now owned by Salesforce)...</p>

		<p>2,600% on an early investment in Ticketfly (a competitor to Ticketmaster, which lets you purchase tickets to events online)...</p>

		<p>1,200% in a little-known cloud computing firm...</p>

		<p>But that&rsquo;s the past&hellip;</p>

		<p>Looking ahead, I&rsquo;m now focusing on the seven newest and most important big trends in America today.</p>

		<p>And for each trend, I&rsquo;ve already identified the best way to play it in the stock market.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s seven stocks that can help you make 1,000% gains in the next few years, as these trends &ldquo;go mainstream.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll find all the details inside this second gift.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s also yours FREE when you take a risk-free trial of <em>The Altucher Report</em>.</p>

		<h3>Special Bonus #3: My Book <em>The Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth</em></h3>
		<img alt="The Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ChooseYourself.jpg" />
		<p>The list price of this hardcover is currently $22.46 on Amazon.</p>

		<p>But I&#39;ll give you an electronic copy of this book&hellip; absolutely FREE as a part of this offer.</p>

		<p>This 279-page book is <em>jam-packed</em> with some of my best income secrets that I personally use to survive and thrive in the new American economy.</p>

		<p>For example, you&rsquo;ll discover...</p>

		<p><strong>***How to make $40,000 a month on Amazon!</strong></p>

		<p>You&#39;ll be amazed when you learn how one of my friends is using Amazon to make more money than 95% of CEOs in the corporate world...</p>

		<p>WITHOUT owning a company, sourcing products or hiring employees... (See page 181.)</p>

		<p><strong>***How to eliminate your debt in 30 seconds or less.</strong></p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll discover a secret method you can use to get rid of your mortgage and credit card debt.</p>

		<p>It has nothing to do with declaring bankruptcy, moving, or hiding your assets&hellip; and it&#39;s 100% legal.</p>

		<p>But I have to warn you... this strategy is NOT for everyone. (See page 218.)</p>

		<p><strong>***How to use my &quot;Idea Matrix&quot; to create your own income... and never rely on corporate America or the government again!</strong></p>

		<p>Worried about depending on Social Security checks?</p>

		<p>Anyone who learns how to use this secret tool may never have to worry about income again! (See page 19.)</p>

		<p><strong>***And much, MUCH more...</strong></p>

		<p>If you respond today to this special offer, you&rsquo;ll get immediate access to all of these moneymaking secrets &mdash; for FREE.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a total value of $439!</p>

		<p>But with today&rsquo;s special offer, you&rsquo;ll NOT pay anywhere near that.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what I propose&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Take a Full Year to Try It &mdash; No Pressure</h3>

		<p>Because of today&rsquo;s unprecedented situation in cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

		<p>And because you probably don&rsquo;t fully know me well&hellip;</p>

		<p>I want to make it as easy and hassle-free as possible for you to try my work.</p>

		<p>So I asked my publisher to lower the price down to a level that would barely cover our publishing costs.</p>

		<p>And we agreed on an incredible deal. Instead of paying the full value of $439... You&rsquo;ll only pay a tiny fraction&hellip; $49!</p>

		<p>And it means that for just 13 cents a day, you can have a full year&rsquo;s subscription of <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>.</p>

		<p>And you&rsquo;ll get everything else I promised today&hellip; including my Cryptocurrency Package.</p>

		<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve also prepared a special &ldquo;risk nothing, keep everything&rdquo; guarantee.</strong></p>

		<p>When you sign up for <em>The Altucher Report</em>, we&#39;ll give you a full year to test out the service &mdash; <u>at no risk to you.</u></p>

		<p>During that year, you&rsquo;ll get 12 new issues &mdash; one a month.</p>

		<p>If, during those first 12 months, you find you&#39;re not satisfied with <em>The Altucher Report</em>&hellip;</p>

		<p>You can simply call or email our customer service team and cancel your subscription.</p>

		<p>We&#39;ll give you a full refund, no questions asked.</p>

		<p>And we&#39;ll let you keep everything you receive during your year as a subscriber &mdash; at no charge.</p>

		<p>You can keep your book <strong><em>Cryptocurrencies 101: How to Make a Fortune From Digital Currencies .</em></strong></p>

		<p>You can keep your <strong>6-video series <em>Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies .</em></strong></p>

		<p>You can keep all the issues&hellip;</p>

		<p><strong><em>And you can keep ALL three bonus gifts.</em></strong></p>

		<p><em>***You can keep everything. This means there&rsquo;s no risk to you at all.</em></p>

		<p>It&#39;s our way of saying thank you for giving <em>The Altucher Report</em> a try.</p>

		<h3>But Please Let Me Know Before February 2</h3>

		<p>As I showed you today, Amazon could make an announcement during its next conference call.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s scheduled for February 2&hellip; precisely at 4 p.m. Eastern.</p>

		<p>Dozens of cryptocurrencies could explode 100%, 500% and even 1,000% or more&hellip; that day alone.</p>

		<p>If you wait until after the announcement, I&rsquo;m afraid it will be too late.</p>

		<p>The opportunity will be lost forever.</p>

		<p>Remember, this is the biggest boom in history.</p>

		<p>You will NEVER see this again&hellip; not in your lifetime.</p>

		<p>This is your only and last chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune.</p>

		<p>It sure sounds impossible, but you know it&rsquo;s NOT!</p>

		<p>It already happened with Bitcoin, where just $100 invested seven years ago... would be worth $6.8 million today!</p>

		<p>And now it&rsquo;s happening again with smaller cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>Today I showed you how Alan A. used these cryptos to turn $8,500 into $7.5 million&hellip; in just six months&hellip;</p>

		<p>How Sean I. turned $15,000 into a $3 million fortune&hellip;</p>

		<p>And how I recently made an investment that returned $1.8 million from a single trade.</p>

		<p>When you think about it like that, you simply have to respond to this offer right away.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s really no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t waste any time&hellip; or you will be left out!</p>
