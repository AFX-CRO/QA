  <h2>You Have One More Step…</h2>
  <h2><span class="red"><u>Please Verify Your Details Below</u></span></h2>


  <p>Congratulations, John Doe.</p>
  <p>You’ve made the important step to accept our valuable Lifetime subscription offer for <em>Alan Knuckman’s Weekly Wealth Alert</em>.</p>
  <p>You now have the ultimate income tool at your disposal – <em>for life!</em></p>
  <p>Thanks to your Lifetime Upgrade you could be collecting cash from these Retirement Windows for a long, long time.</p>
  <p>And you’ve reserved VIP benefits like the “Direct Dial” Customer Care Plan.</p>
  <p>But before we go on, I have something very important to show you…</p>
  <p>Please check your first and last name below to make sure it’s spelled correctly.</p>
  <p>It’s ok if it’s your nickname or some other name you go by, just please make sure we have your information correct in the box below:</p>
  
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Lifetime Customer Account Information:</h3>
      <h3>John Doe</h3>
  </div>

<p>Here’s why it’s important your name is spelled correctly…</p>
<p>Because you’ve decided to become a Lifetime Member of <em>Alan Knuckman’s Weekly Wealth Alert</em>, I want to thank you by making you an offer we’ve not made before.</p>
<p>Basically…</p>

<h3>I’ve Put $6,500 in Your Membership Account Under Your Name…</h3>

<p>Before I explain the details, please understand we can only afford to make this offer <u>once</u> for our most loyal customers like yourself…</p>
<p>So here’s what I’ve arranged for you today…</p>
<p>I firmly believe that our weekly paycheck systemis the <strong>best way</strong> to make constant gains in good or bad markets. </p>
<p>After beginning as a clerk on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, Alan has worked his way through nearly all the aspects of the options markets…</p>
<p>For the past 25+ years. </p>
<p>Transitioning from a clerk to a floor trader has given him an inside view of the markets that normal investors just don’t have. </p>
<p>It’s given him a sound trading edge to profit in all market conditions. </p>
<p>But Alan grew tired of watching corporate fat cats game the market, and make millions from insider information and high-level research that the average American couldn’t access. </p>
<p>So his new mission is simple – to help real, everyday Americans like you… Profit from the sameresearch as these corporate drones!</p>
<p>Research that can help you build your portfolio, or retirement account… <em>So that you can focus on the important things in life</em>! </p>
<p>To do that Alan has cracked open his floor trader playbook, incorporated patent-pending technical software called the WPI indicator, and he’s bringing that information to average people, not just the super wealthy. </p>
<p>We’re talking about taking advantage of the best trading windows… Making explosive plays…. Not just once, but every quarter.</p>
<p>With multiple fresh recommendations every single week. </p>
<p>Remember, some of the weekly paycheck examples that Alan showed you could have made you over $5,290, $10,200… Even $35,700… From a single trade… And in just a week’s time… </p>
<p>Imagine what that much extra money could mean to you and your family. </p>
<p>You could dramatically accelerate your time to retire by years – maybe even retire WAY earlier than you’ve planned! </p>
<p>How you spend your extra weekly paycheck income is completely up to you, but I’m sure you’re smart enough to think of a few good way ways to put those extra profits to work… </p>
<p>With an absolute minimum of time &amp; effort for you… </p>
<p>And that’s why we’ve put together something very special for you. </p>
<p>We call it… </p>
 
 <h3>Alan Knuckman’s <em>Power Trading Network</em></h3>

<p>Imagine having your own personal floor trader to help expertly guide you through the market’s ups and downs… With 25+ years of investment experience… And step-by-step instructions the whole way…</p>
<p>That’s the kind of experience using Alan’s research can give YOU.</p>
<p>Please don’t live with any regrets knowing that you looked the profit-building opportunity of a lifetime square in the eyes, and then passed on it.</p>
<p>Alan calls this elite Membership the <em>Power Trading Network</em> because it gives you all the investment tools you need to build your personal portfolio and retirement plans!</p>
<p>You can expect “insider access” to all of Alan’s research, including every type of investment opportunity, or new service, that Alan ever publishes...</p>
<p>Step-by-step instructions and email notifications when it’s time to buy or sell a recommendation. (You can even get a text whenever it’s time to check your inbox for a new alert!)</p>

<h3>It’s Like Having a Personal Floor Trader</h3>

<p>When you join Alan’s <em>Power Trading Network</em> today you’ll be part of the highest level of service that we offer.</p>
<p>You’ll collect ALL of the following VIP <em>Network</em> benefits like:</p>

<ul class="checkmark">
    <li><span class="red">Lifetime access to Alan’s latest research service, the <em>42-Day Retirement Plan</em></span></li>
    <li><span class="red">Lifetime access to Alan’s upcoming daily market newsletter at NO additional cost</span></li>
    <li><span class="red">A lifetime subscription to <em>Weekly Wealth Alert</em></span></li>
    <li><em>Power Trading Network</em> bonus reports – FREE for life</li>
    <li><strong>A lifetime subscription to ALL Alan’s future research services</strong></li>
    <li>Multiple weekly trade and sell alerts – for life</li>
    <li>Save thousands on subscription fees</li>
    <li>Text message alerts</li>
    <li>No renewal or maintenance fees – EVER</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s simple…</p>
<p>This is just a hands-down great deal.</p>
<p>The best way to save thousands on subscription fees, and gain access to all of the trades and research that we’ll ever publish.</p>
<p>But these aren’t the only benefits to joining Alan’s <em>Power Trading Network</em>.</p>
<p>You’ll also receive…</p>

<h3>White Glove Customer Service</h3>

<p>I don’t want you to waste time on hold.</p>
<p>When you become an elite <em>Power Trading Network</em> Member – you’ll be at the front of the line for customer service.</p>
<p>I’ve arranged for a personal <em>Power Trading Network</em> customer service agent. </p>
<p>His name is Matt, and he doesn’t work out of a warehouse in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>He’s right down the hall from me, and he will help you with any account issues.</p>
<p>For <em>Power Trading Network</em> Members, you’ll never be more than a phone call away for help with your subscription.</p>
<p>If you sign up today I’ll also include...</p>

<h3>The Legacy Program</h3>

<p>The Legacy Program is one of the most important VIP benefits you’ll receive when you join Alan’s <em>Network</em>.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This means that not only will you have lifetime access to every piece of research that Alan ever publishes, but that you can ALSO hand your <em>Network</em> Membership down to the next generation.</p>
<p>You can transfer your Membership to someone just like any other asset.</p>
<p>You can feel secure in knowing that you’re passing along a lifetime resource of investment research, so your family’s wealth has the opportunity to grow for generations to come.</p>
<p>All you have to do to receive all of these benefits and more – for life – is to make the smart decision to upgrade to Alan’s <em>Power Trading Network</em>, at an incredible discount…</p>
<p>But I’ve saved one of the best benefits for last…</p>

<h3>Members-Only LIVE Events</h3>

<p>Each and every month we’ll host a live Members-Only conference call.</p>
<p>Alan will touch on all of the market trends, our active recommendations…</p>
<p>And the best part – YOU can submit questions and Alan will choose the best ones to answer for the group.</p>
<p>You’ll be invited to every event that Alan ever hosts.</p>
<p>These extra events will cost you nothing to attend…</p>
<p>Think of it as a thank you for joining Alan’s “insider” <em>Network</em>.</p>

<h3>A Lifetime of Savings and VIP Benefits</h3>

<p>This is the ultimate deal.</p>
<p>One flat rate, no future fees or renewals of any kind.</p>
<p>You’ll never miss a single investment research opportunity or new service Alan comes up with in the future.</p>
<p>You get VIP benefits – like White Glove Customer Service and the Legacy Program – that you can’t get anywhere else.</p>
<p>You’ll get full access to bonus live events and special reports.</p>
<p>It only takes one simple step to receive all of these incredible benefits.</p>
<p>Here’s how…</p>


<h3>You’re Only One Click Away From Joining the <em>Power Trading Network</em></h3>

<p>When you join today you’ll get access to every piece of research that we ever publish… for the rest of your life…</p>
<p>How much is this insider access worth to you?</p>
<p>Before you answer, consider this…</p>
<p>On top of the <strong>$7,500 yearly <em>Power Trading Network</em> value</strong> you get, you also get thousands more in benefits that no one can ever take away from you.</p>
<p>The White Glove Customer Care and Legacy Programs aren’t for sale.</p>
<p>I’m sure I could charge up to $2,000 for this customer care and legacy service, if we ever made it available for our regular subscribers.</p>
<p>So that means in one year alone, the total you’d pay for all of your <em>Network</em> benefits would be $9,500.</p>
<p>If you choose to pay for two years, now you’d be in for $19,000.</p>
<p>Three years and we’re close to $28,500.</p>
<p>But don’t worry… </p>

<h3>I’m Not Going to Ask You to Pay Anything Close to This Amount Today</h3>

<p>I promised you a special deal… Good for today only… And I meant it.</p>
<p>In fact, I think you’ll be surprised just how affordable this lifetime <em>Network</em> access can be.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’d like to make this deal a real “no-brainer.”</p>
<p>So today… Through this page only… You can join Alan Knuckman’s <em>Power Trading Network</em> for a tiny fraction of the price.</p>
<p>One click and you get every explosive play ever put out by Alan and his team... Every piece of research he will ever share… Every report... Every issue... Every live conference call… The Legacy Program… Your lifetime White Glove Customer Service plan… And all the rest…</p>
<p>But as part of this special new-members-only offer – I’m also going to sweeten the pot:</p>

<h3>NEW-MEMBER OFFER:</h3>
<h3>I’ve Applied a $6,500 Discount to <br>Your Account</h3>

<p>You can join right now as lifetime member to all of Alan’s services, for just one last, one-time $1,000 upgrade fee. </p>
<p>Again, this is a one-time payment for a <em>lifetime </em>of access. </p>
<p>There are no renewal fees. No maintenance fees.</p>
<p>No hidden charges.</p>
<p>You’ll <strong>never </strong>see this low of a price for all of these perks!</p>
<p><strong>So click here now – and you’ll get all of the services and benefits, with a Lifetime Membership to Alan Knuckman’s <em>Power Trading Network</em>. </strong></p>
<p>Remember, I’ve gone ahead and made an arrangement to put a $6,500 “credit” in your customer account… </p>
<p>It’s my way of thanking you for being a loyal reader.</p>
<p><strong>But this offer is only good for the time that you’re on this page… It will expire when you close out of this page. </strong></p>
<p>So instead of investing $7,500 like everyone else has to pay… </p>
<p>For the next 72 hours only, because you’re one of our best readers, you can claim an unlimited subscription to Alan’s <em>Power Trading Network</em>, including his new groundbreaking <em>42-Day Retirement Plan</em>, for just an extra $1,000. </p>
<p>That’s it. </p>
<p>Yes, it’s somewhat ridiculous how cheap I’ve made this offer. </p>
<p>Especially considering that a single recommendation could easily cover this entire subscription fee <u>many</u> times over… </p>
<p>But again, this charter offer is only good for as long as you’re on this special page. </p>
<p>Also to make sure that only our <em>most loyal</em> readers are able to take advantage of this very steep discount, there will be no refunds on this last one-time charge. </p>
<p>If you decide to pass on this opportunity, you will never see the $6,500 discount again. </p>
<p>We’ll go ahead and mark your customer account as forfeiting the $6,500 <em>Power Trading Network </em>credit. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re at all interested in securing ALL of these explosive moneymaking opportunities, then you should say yes today by clicking here.</p>
<p>Right now. </p>
<p>You can review the offer details again, but I believe you’ll find this is one of the most generous and potentially profitable charter offers that I’m personally aware of – and I sincerely hope you’ll say yes.</p>
