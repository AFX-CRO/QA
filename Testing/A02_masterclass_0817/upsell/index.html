    <h3 style="font-weight:300">For NEW Members  of <em>The Altucher Report</em> Only</h3>
    <center>
      <p><strong>Please do not — under any circumstances whatsoever — share ANY of this with non-cleared persons  (including family and friends and coworkers).</strong></p>
    </center>
  <p>  Dear Reader,</p>

  <p>Hi, I’m Doug Hill, publisher for <em>The Altucher Report</em>.</p>

  <p>Thanks for taking the initiative and joining us today.</p>

  <p>Your order is being processed. In a minute or two, you’ll receive a confirmation email with everything I promised.</p> 

  <p>***But before we get to that, I have a very IMPORTANT update on cryptocurrencies.</p>

  <p>As James showed you today, historians will call this the biggest boom in history.</p> 

  <p>His book and masterclass will help you get started on your path to turn $100 into a retirement fortune.</p>

  <p>But after James launched his presentation online, he came across a new opportunity in the crypto space…</p> 

  <p>One that could lead to BIGGER gains… in a much FASTER way.</p>

  <p>In short, he found a “glitch” in the cryptocurrency market…</p>

  <p>One that allows you to buy one of the hottest cryptocurrencies out there….</p>

  <p>At a huge 95% discount….</p>

  <p>Giving you the chance to turn each $1,000 into as much as $25,986 in the next few months.</p>

  <p>No, I’m not talking about Bitcoin.</p> 

  <p>This “glitch” involves another cryptocurrency that has been called “the new Bitcoin.”</p>

  <p>Let me tell you all the details…</p>

  <h3>The Last Time this Happened, You Could Have Turned $5,000 into $129,932… in a Little More than 3 Months</h3>

  <p>If you’ve heard of Bitcoin, there’s a good chance you may have heard about Ethereum too.</p>
  
<p>The New York Times recently published an article with the headline: “Move over Bitcoin. Ethereum is the digital currency of the moment.”</p>
  
<p>The article went on to say: “If recent trends continue, the value of Ethereum could race past Bitcoin’s in the coming weeks.”</p>
  
<p>And Business Insider says “proponents of Ethereum see unlimited upside.”</p>
  
<p>No wonder it’s already minting millionaires…</p>
  
<p>Bloomberg even reported recently that one Ethereum investor “made $200 million in one month!”</p> 
  
<p>But here’s the thing….</p>
  
<p>With Ethereum trading close to $400, it’s no longer dirt cheap.</p>
  
<p>But that’s where James’ so called “glitch” comes in.</p>
  
<p>James found a way for you to “buy Ethereum” for just about $15.</p>
  
<p>That’s 95% below what Ethereum is trading right now.</p>
  
<p>And that’s a big deal…</p>
  
<p>Because the last time Ethereum was trading for just about $15, investors made an absolute fortune.</p>
  
<p>Take a look…</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/LF/ALR/CryptoMasterClass_0817/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-19.png" alt="graph"/>
</center>

<p>Had you bought Ethereum when it was trading for $15…</p>

<p>You could have pocketed a gain as high as 2,499%... in a little more than three months.</p>

<p>That means had you invested just $1,000, you could have cashed out with $25,986.</p>

<p>Double the initial capital, and you’d have pocketed $51,972.</p>

<p>Invest a little more, say $5,000… and now you’re looking at $129,932…</p>

<p>All in a little more than three months!</p>

<p>Now, remember… </p>

<p>These gains were only possible because Ethereum was trading for $15 earlier this year.</p>

<p>Right now it’s trading for $344.</p>

<p>In other words, it’s no longer dirt cheap.</p>

<p>But what if you could “buy Ethereum” for $15.76?</p>

<p>Most people have no idea this is possible…</p>

<p>But because of James’ background in computer science…</p>

<p>And because he’s been involved in the crypto space since 2013…</p>

<p>He knows exactly how this “glitch” works.</p>

<p>And he told me all the details. I don’t want to bore you to death with nerdy technical details…</p>

<p>In short, computer programmers had to recode Ethereum back in July 2016…</p>

<p>And that’s what created this “glitch” in the crypto market…</p>

<p>A “glitch” that allows you to legally buy an entirely new version of “Ethereum” for just about $15.</p>

<p>Remember, had you bought Ethereum when it was trading for $15, you could have pocketed a gain of 2,499%...</p>

<p>Enough to turn a small retirement account of 10 grand into more than a quarter million dollars!</p>

<p>All that in just a little more than three months.</p>

<p>If you missed that boom in Ethereum, don’t worry.</p>

<p>While nothing is guaranteed,  this “glitch” essentially gives you a second shot at scoring a big fortune.</p>

<p>We're talking about collecting the BIG money….</p> 

<p>The kind that can change your life... get you a bigger house... pay for a trip around the world… secure a richer retirement... quit your job early...</p>

<p>And you won’t have to wait years.</p> 

<p>You could see those life-changing gains in a matter of months.</p> 

<p>And to help you get started…</p>

<p>James put all the details in a special report called <strong>The Crypto Glitch that Could help You Make 25 Times Your Money</strong>.</p>

<h3>I’ve Reserved this Special Report for You. There’s Only One Catch…</h3>


<p>This “glitch” has one big limitation: </p>

<p><strong>A lot of buying pressure could ruin the opportunity for everyone.</strong></p>

<p>See, this opportunity doesn’t have as much trading volume as big cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Just to give you an example, in a 24-hour period more than 524,000 Bitcoins exchange hand.</p>

<p>In comparison, the volume in this “glitch” was just a little over 14,000 coins.</p>

<p>For that reason, a tiny change in buying pressure could move prices really quick.</p>

<p>That means this is sensitive information that we can’t share with thousands of people. </p>

<p>And that’s why we’ll have to limit access to a smaller, more elite group of only the most serious readers.</p>

<p>So here’s the deal…</p>

<p>Only the first 100 members of <em>The Altucher Report</em> who RSVP today will gain access to the report <strong>The Crypto Glitch that Could help You Make 25 Times Your Money</strong>.</p>

<p>Like I said, we’re cutting this off at such a low number because of the delicate nature of this opportunity.</p>

<p>But if you’re lucky enough to get in while the doors are open, then you'll have a shot at making an absolute fortune in the coming months.</p>

<p>I’ll show you can you can secure your spot in just a moment…</p>

<p>Before I get to that, you should know two very important things… </p>

      <p>You’ll never need to pay another cent to gain access to these powerful strategies. It’s all included in your membership…. Which will never expire.</p> 


      <h3>So let’s add this up… </h3>
      <ul class="checkmark">  
        <li><strong><u>LIFETIME BENEFIT #1:</u></strong> Access to Every <em>Altucher Report</em> Issue and Recommendation ($99 annual value)</li>
        <li><strong><u>LIFETIME BENEFIT #2:</u></strong> Access to Our “Direct Dial”  Customer Care Plan ($99 annual value)</li>
        <li><strong><u>LIFETIME BENEFIT #3:</u></strong> Access to Our Full Library of Reports ($99 annual value)  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>But remember, you’ll claim access to all these benefits FOR LIFE.</p> 

      <p>That means over five years you’ll claim more than $1,485 of value… </p>

      <p>Over 10 years you’ll claim more than $2,970...</p>
        <center>
          <p>*** And over 15 years you’ll claim $4,455... *** </p>
        </center>
      <p>Now, don’t worry…</p>

<p>Access to our lifetime program doesn’t cost $4,400.</p> 

<p>It doesn’t even cost $1,000...</p> 

<p>Or even $550.</p> 

<p>In fact, normally we ask our lifetime members to pay just a $500 one-time fee...</p>

<p>Again, that’s a one-time payment for a lifetime of access. </p>

<p><strong>*** There are no renewal fees.</strong></p> 

<p><strong>*** No maintenance fees.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*** No hidden charges.</strong></p>

<p>It’s simple…</p>

<p>You pay one fee to secure a lifetime of research. </p>

<p>But it gets better… </p>

<h3>It’s called the <u>Legacy Program</u>...</h3>
<p>In essence, this program ensures your heirs will continue to benefit from your lifetime plan long after you’re gone.</p>

<p>By subscribing to this plan today, you’ll be able to pass your membership down to a family member.</p>

<p>That way you could keep this program going throughout generations of your family, starting with your children, grandchildren or immediate heirs.</p>

<p>When it’s time, simply have them dial your liaison… and ask for the lifetime plan to be transferred to their name.</p> 

<p>There are no transfer fees or charges of any type for your heirs.</p>

<p>You’ll not only have the tools to better your retirement, but you could reward your family for generations by acting today.</p> 
<h3>Oh, and by the way...</h3>
<p>There’s one more thing… </p>

<p>By acting RIGHT NOW… </p>

<p>TODAY…</p>

<p>Through THIS MESSAGE ONLY… </p>

<p>You can join for HALF OFF the normal lifetime price.</p>

<p>That’s just $250.</p>

<p>After that, you’re set for life.</p>

<p>Again, no more fees or renewal notices…</p> 

<p>Just a lifetime of recommendations. </p>


<p>And you’ll be one of the 100 of my readers who will secure access to <strong><strong>The Crypto Glitch that Could help You Make 25 Times Your Money</strong></strong> today…</p>

<p>Giving you the chance to turn $1,000 into $25,986… in the next few months.</p>

<p>To join this program and receive every potentially wealth-multiplying play... every report... and every issue... simply click the “YES, UPGRADE MY ACCOUNT” button below.</p>


<center>
<p>*** We’ll automatically cancel the fee you just paid, and instead charge your card a total one-time payment of just $250. *** </p>
</center>

<p>Then we’ll send you to a page with your LIFETIME logins.</p>

<p>You’ll be set... for as long as you’d like.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can click “NO, I WANT TO FORFEIT MY CHANCE TO UPGRADE,” and we’ll simply take you to your annual confirmation page.</p>

<p>But remember, if you choose no, you’ll pass on this opportunity forever. You may never see another message like this one… at this price.</p> 

<p>The choice is yours.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you on our lifetime list.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br /><img src="https://duip7hn7nchpo.cloudfront.net/signature-doug-hill.jpg" alt="doug hill signature"/><br />
