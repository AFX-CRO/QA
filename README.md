# A Place For Mockup Development
This repo is a place for developers to house their coded mockups of CRO projects.  

## Adding a new folder
When adding a new type of page file please include three files in it. 
  1.  An index.html file that is a fully rendered out page to act as an example of what a completed page of that type should look like. Since we don’t want to actually get traffic to these pages add: ‘<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW">’ to the top of the head. 
  2.  An example of the actual page. We can provide a link in the readme file as well as the page source to compare with the mockup.
  3.  A readme file that explains how to use that folder and a preview link to that pages index.html file
